                        In short, Ventus is a student management software, better know as our built in-house
                        Accommodation
                        Management application. It is designed to simplify, to streamline, and ultimately to decrease
                        the
                        work required of students with disabilities in receiving their approved academic accommodations.
                        Ventus is also used to facilitate the sharing of accommodation-related information between all
                        partners in the accommodation process. Partners include you, the Learning Specialist, Academic
                        Accommodations support staff,
                        Professors, Students, and Faculties.

                        As a Learning Specialist, you will be using Ventus as part of your day-to-day workflow. This is
                        where you'll store all meeting notes, generate letters of support, and establish accommodation
                        supports for students. It's important to remember that, like any software, Ventus is meant to
                        help your day-to-day
                        operations, not do the tasks for you.<br>

                        the Learning Specialist portal.

                                in the LS portal. This includes the Calendar, Follow-ups page, Student list, Templates,
                                and brief descriptions of the Hubs. You'll find that some pages are used more often than
                                others. For example, you'll rely on the Follow-ups page to notify you of any
                                student-specific updates.<br>
                                <br>As part of the new workflow, the Follow-ups page will include
                                a notification each time a new student is assigned to you and every time a student
                                schedules an appointment. Ventus calendars will also be used to track and schedule your
                                meetings.
